# WisdomIsTheQuest
Top-down exploration and quiz game, where the player gains knowledge towards wisdom

The idea is that this will a Zelda/Rogue/Apshai-esque type of game, at least aesthetically, where the player will travel between different zones to meet a range of NPCs who will ask questions... and the player will respond from a multiple-choice interface

These interactions will gradually open up additional answers, towards the player eventually being able to answer the Big Question at the end

This format should be adaptable between different subject matters, too - so there can be a broad educational aspect, too, up to any kind of level

For example:

The Player character could be asked (if the subject matter was chemistry):

"What is the key characteristic of an allotrope?"

Until the player has visited an area/NPC who explains to them about molecular structures, then the only option for response the player would have would be

"I don't know"

BUT, when they HAVE visited the relevant area(s)/NPC(s) and worked through their dialogues - maybe trading objects found around the landscape (a microscope, a bunsen burner... you get the idea), and have been exposed to the information about graphite and diamond... then the range of answers can expand to include both the default "I don't know", and a couple of others (including the "correct" one - or at least the most relevant one)

Through this process of exploration and interaction the player will be exposed to a whole raft of information (and connections), and hopefully the play experience will offer some educational value

Just imagine using this format to teach students about chemistry, biology, physics, history, philosophy...

The only limit really is the questions you can put in (and the relevant responses!)

ENJOY!
